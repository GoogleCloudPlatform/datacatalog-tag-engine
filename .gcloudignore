# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
# To see what files do get uploaded, run this command: gcloud meta list-files-for-upload


.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# Ignore files specified in the .gitignore (keep the leading '#'):
#!include:.gitignore

# To explicitly include important files that are in `.gitignore`:
!te_client_secret.json
!tagengine.ini
