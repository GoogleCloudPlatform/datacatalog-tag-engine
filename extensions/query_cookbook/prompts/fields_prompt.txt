Extract the select clause from each SQL query, sort the select clauses by their frequency, and return the most frequently occurring ones. For example, the select clause in the SQL query "select w_c_id as id, w_s_symb as symbol, w_dts, w_action from oltp.WatchHistoryHistorical" is "select w_c_id as id, w_s_symb as symbol, w_dts, w_action". It does not include the from clause. Do not include the from clause, where clause or join clause in your answer. Do not include "select *" in your answer. Order the select clauses by most frequent to least frequent.
