Extract the joins from the SQL queries and then return the most frequently occurring joins. For example, the join in the SQL query "select * from oltp.WatchHistoryHistorical h join oltp.WatchHistoryIncremental i on h.w_c_id = i.w_c_id" is "from oltp.WatchHistoryHistorical h join oltp.WatchHistoryIncremental i on h.w_c_id = i.w_c_id". Do not include this example in your answer. Order the joins by most frequent to least frequent.
