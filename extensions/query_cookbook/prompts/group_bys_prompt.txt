Extract the group by clause from each SQL query, rank the results, and return the most frequently occurring group by clauses. For example, the group by clause in the SQL query "select w_c_id, count(*) from oltp.WatchHistoryHistorical group by w_c_id, w_s_symb" is "group by w_c_id". Do not include this example in your answer. Do not include "group by 1" or "group by 1, 2" in your answer. Order the group by clauses by most frequent to least frequent.
