Extract the where clauses from the SQL queries and then return the most frequently occurring where clauses. For example, the where clause in the SQL query "select * from oltp.WatchHistoryHistorical where w_c_id between 1 and 5 and w_c_name IS NULL or w_c_addr IS NULL" is "where w_c_id between 1 and 5 and w_c_name IS NULL or w_c_addr IS NULL". Do not include this example in your answer. Order the where clauses by most frequent to least frequent.
