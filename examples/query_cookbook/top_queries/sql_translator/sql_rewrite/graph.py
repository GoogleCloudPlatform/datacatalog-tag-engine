def minimise_graph(graph):
    """graph is a dictionary of <tuple> -> set(<tuple>)

    This algorithm will remove any target <tuple> that also has
    an alternative indirect path.

    Example: (1) -> (2,3), (3) -> (4,5), (4) -> (2,6)

    The mapping for (1) will be simplified to (1) -> (3), as the
    2 target can be found through 3 -> 4, 4 -> 2.
